# William Wordsworth

## Life

Born in 1770, Lockermouth.

Gets degree at Cambridge University in 1791.

He left for France, where he stayed for a year. He had an affair with Annette Vallon, and the two had a daughter.

But why did he go to France? Because, like other youngsters of his generation, he is enthusiastic about the [French revolution](french-revolution.md), and its ideals.

Once the revolution started to get violent, though, he changed his mind. This is due to the famous **civil war** in England in the 1600s. He was afraid it was going to spread over to his nation of origin.

After what became of the revolution, his thoughts were more on the **conservative** side, in political and religious matters, unlike before. He was more progressive before.

He of course, rushed back to England, leaving Annette and his daughter in France and never seeing them again. 
He settled in **Southwest England**, with his sister Dorothy.

In 1795 he met [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](samuel-taylor-coleridge.md), and together they wrote the [Lyrical Ballads](lyrical-ballads.md).

In later editions of the Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth included his Preface, effectively making the **manifesto of Romantic poetry**.

## Themes and style

### Manifesto of Romantic poetry
In his Preface, Wordsworth said this:
+ Poetry should **abandon** the **rigid forms** of poetic diction (such as...) and embrace more popular forms, like the ballad.

+ The poet's language has to be simple and direct.

+ **Ordinary people** and the circumstances of **everyday life** should be a new type of subject-matter for poetry.

Finally, he said that poets are in no way superior than ordinary people ("a man among men"), except for their sensibility. We can link this fact to the [allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave), made by Plato. But what does all of this mean? We'll see in the poems I'll cover here.

### Nature

Nature is **inspiration** to Wordsworth. Inspiration, beauty and delight. 

It is a **recurring theme** in his poems, he even wrote an autobiographical poem about his relationship with nature in the different stages of life (It's called "The Prelude"). 

Wordsworth says that nature gives a lot of beneficial effects to mankind:
+ it comforts a pertubed mind

+ it inspires elevated thoughts and passionate emotions
00p
+ it promotes an individual's spiritual development and moral behaviour

+ it allows a connection with the divine principle immanent in everything created

Let's think this through: society, in Wordsworth's times, was split into the **worker class**, who lived on the edge and stressfully but had access to more possibilities in the city, and **rustic people**, who enjoyed a hard and slow-paced but happy and religious life.

That's why nature gives benefitial effects to mankind.

We can see one of **Rousseau**'s most famous tenets in Wordsworth's words: The ones in contact with Nature keep a gift that most men lose; a pure and noble soul.

> Note: Cities are not bad per se, but the **social conventions** make it hard for a man to retain his purity.

### Childhood

And what could be more pure than a child? For him, childhood is a **state of innocence and purity**. But when they grow up into adulthood, they become corrupt by the social conventions. That does not happen if a man lives with Nature, like rustic people do.

### Memory and imagination

This is another recurring theme in his poems.

Memory is a source of poetry: a recollected emotion, if reworked by the poet's **imagination**, can be transformed into verses that convey the original emotion. 

Also, in his Preface, he said that poets should *not* write in the heat of an emotional moment, because they might not even know what they're really feeling.

Instead, they must contemplate their emotion in peace to achieve a proper understanding of what they felt.

### Style

Wordsworth writes his poems in **blank verse**. He wanted to write in a style with simple imagery and language that resonated with rhythms and idioms of everyday English.

> Note: This didn't mean he was going to use dialects! He wanted his language clean of them, just like Manzoni. Sometimes, though,  he let his guard off.
