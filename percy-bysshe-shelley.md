# Percy Bysshe Shelley

He pertained to the [Second Generation](romanticism.md#second-generation) of Romantic poets.

Shelley was just like Wordsworth: he uses sonets and odes (canon structures) to compose, but he changes the theme of his poetry.

## Life

He was aristocratic.

Goes to Eton College and Oxford University, but he doesn't want to be there, he doesn't want to follow the conventional education. He is *against it*. It is obvious why: his parents wanted to grant him a great education at these very prestigious schools.

Gets expelled for his pamphlet *The Necessity for Atheism*. (Yippee)

In that pamphlet he stated that religion, in all its forms, is a form of *tyranny*.

Little problem: he writes this in Ireland! Strong Catholic country.

In the same year (he was 17), he runs away from home with a *Harriet Westbrook*. His family isn't really OK with his decision... Besides the fact that he ran away, he did that with a commoner! That's a no-no for an aristocratic.

They get married, two babies and all that stuff. Alright.

He continues to write radical stuff, and they live off of charity, because:
+ they don't have a real job
+ they are wanderers.

He then moves to London and meets William Godwin. He falls in love with his 16 y/o daughter, *Mary*. But he's already married! Nonetheless, he left England with her and her sister-in-law, Claire.

His family is very angry now! They don't want to see from him ever again.

After some time, they get to Lord Byron's house in Geneva. Claire comes too because she has a crush on Byron. What happens when they're there? Harriet unalives. 

Now he can legally marry Mary! (Yippee again)

---

He finds himself in Lerici, La Spezia. Lord Byron has a house there too.

He dies in the bay.

His ashes can be found in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.

## Themes and Style
This guy remained radical through his entire life.

We can see this in all of his works:
+ Atheism
+ Irish nationalism
+ Vegetarianism (lol)
+ Republicanism
+ Free love (ofc, he was pretty darn free)

But, most importantly, **revolutionary idealism**. This aspect was later influenced by William Godwin's theories. 

###### What did he think?
Shelley wanted revolution; he wanted a *"rebirth" of society*, because he felt he lived in a world dominated by inequalities (tyranny, religion and such) and moved by selfishness.

And who could lead that revolution, who could be the prophets, other than poets? Yeah, nobody. Just poets. Only poets. They are to be considered as heroes, liberators and philosophers. He felt like they were the *unacknowledged legislators of the world*, ...

Alright. So, although he is an Atheist, he believes in something supernatural that pervaded nature and realized itself in art. Weird, but, by giving voice to this supernatural thing in the celebration of life and beauty, art's sensual pleasures could improve society and poetry could bring about moral good in this unjust world.

###### Romanticism in him

His works reflects many of the [Romantic themes](romanticism.md#themes), but in a Shelleyan way.

How can a poem be Shelleyan though? 


## Poems

### Queen Mab
His first major work was *Queen Mab, a Philosophical poem*, 

Utopian future described in it. Just like Thomas Moore's *Utopia*.

### The Revolt of Islam

It is 1818 and someone talks about Islam!

It reflects on the current state of Britain and on the failure of the French revolution.

Why did revolution fail? Besides the fact that it didn't go to England, and it was necessary, it failed because the Revolution transformed France into chaos, civil war, which no one wanted.

> Digression: It is not said in this poem, but the revolution failed in England also because the nation was too worried about getting big and rich with the Industrial revolution and just becoming a super power. Spending money on a revolution seemed useless.
>
> Also, since money on revolution is useless, we can say the same for wars, except for three: 
> + Crimea war, fought for the port.
> + Boer war, fought in South Africa (against Dutchies) for the diamonds and gold.
> + Opium war, a commercial war fought for opium (ofc).
>
> They were ez wins, so they had a big ego.

He never backs down on the revolutionary ideals, but he acknowledges its failure.

What does he do then? He starts preaching for a bloodless revolt! Something that is kind of impossible, you know. Bloodless seems like an oxymoron.

> Digression #2: Only in 1914, in the beginning of WW1, England starts to revolt.
>
> And about wars, we cannot say the same for this one; this was not an ez win at all.

### Vindication of men's rights
Something something

Mary's mother also wrote *Vindication of women's rights*.

> Digression: Mary's dad was an anarchist philosopher and Mary's mom was a feminist. What a nice environment to grow up in! Mary ends up reading a ton of books from a young age, even the ones she shouldn't read, because her parents just don't care. That's how she wrote Frankenstein.


### Ode to the West Wind

:warning: Important! Study well. Always refer to the [poem](https://www.litcharts.com/poetry/percy-bysshe-shelley/ode-to-the-west-wind).

This is an Ode. (of course sherlock)

It was written in a wood beside the River Arno, near Florence.
He gets up the Appennini and can see all the way to the gulf of Naples.

###### Goals

With this ode, he wants to send a message to all of us: the message of **revolution**.

He brings this concept and Nature together by transforming into **wind**, just like Wordsworth did with his clouds and stuff.

###### Structure

Ode made by 5 sonnets.

5 parts:

#### First

*The Wind moves through the earth.*

The leaves! Oh, the leaves... They're needed to cover the seeds. But what kind of seeds? The seeds of the **revolution**, my guy!

The leaves cover the seeds and keep them warm until spring comes around. After that, they will sprout.

###### Duality of leaves
They can be interpreted both as leaves (from trees) or sheets of paper. The wind wants to take down the leaves off of trees, and similarly *I* want to spread this message around. That's why *I* am the Wind.

> Note: the sheets of paper are his words, creating a synecdoche.

What happens when the Spring comes? The Zephyr (warm wind) blows, and the seeds sprout. And what does the transition from winter to spring mean? It is a message of hope.

#### Second

*The Wind moves through the sky.*

The same thing happens in here. 

What are the leaves of the sky? Clouds!

What happens when Wind tries to blow on the clouds? It rains! And rain is a **regenerative force**, something needed for life. 

Clouds are the product of *tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean*.

> Note: Heaven here means sky.

Look at how he says that the sky has a *blue surface*, describing it as if it was the ocean. Now, is the ocean colouring the sky or viceversa? It's the sky that changes colour of the sea! 

Maenads! Important. Find out what they are. Because the Clouds look like fierce Maenads.

###### Link between the parts

The last verse of this stanza states "Black rain, fire and hail".
1. Black rain → black leaves
2. fire → red/yellow leaves
3. hail → pebbles

#### Third

*The Wind moves through the sea.*

> Note: he sees the Mediterranean sea, which is usually calm, but not in autumn.



#### Fourth and Fifth

*The Wind self-reflects.*

Fourth and Fifth part is the poet's will to become wind.

In the first three verses he cites the first three parts.

###### Youth

The poet here really wants to emphasize how young people have it easy for this kinda thing.

+ "If even I were as in my boyhood" → Babies don't have limits, adults do. Romantic thought!
+ Thorns of life = unable to flee = *Adulthood*.
+ Heavy weight of hours = a ton of hours lived = *Adulthood*.

###### Lyre

He wants to become a lyre, an instrument.

Homer reference! So cool.

However, he mentions that the forest sings too. 

Nottingham forest reference! Cooler. :sunglasses:

###### Real Duality of leaves

Here is expressed the duality of leaves [mentioned before](#duality-of-leaves).

The "Unawakened Earth" is really England.

###### Spring

The last verse is optimistic: if Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?

If 

### Ozymandias

This is a sonnet.

### To a Skylark

### Prometheus Unbound

Subtitle of Frankenstein: *The modern Prometheus!*

> Explanation of Prometheus Myth.

Why is he the modern Prometheus? Frankenstein made life from the dead bodies of many.

> Digression over how *Frankenstein* was born as a book, and how it served as a source of income for the family.

### A Defence of Poetry

Poetry is absolutely necessary. He has always Radical positions.

### England in 1819

:warning: Also important. Always refer to the [poem](https://www.litcharts.com/poetry/percy-bysshe-shelley/england-in-1819).

Unlike Wordsworth, he reacts (and writes) immediately. He doesn't wait 6 years in tranquility.

###### Structure

The poem is made of a long list of subjects, followed by the last two verses that give them a meaning.

###### Kings and Princes

Shelley says here that the king are old, mad, blind, despised and dying.
He is talking about King George III.

This doesn't imply that the next kings (current princes) are any better: Both King George IV and George V are not well-received either.

> Note: George IV squanders money just because he can. That's why he's a bad king.

###### Rulers

###### People

*"A people starved and stabbed in the untilled field"*: exactly what happened in Peterloo Massacre.

###### Army

Prey to those who governs it, Liberticide to the people. The people were doing nothing bad (listening to a speaker), but since the law said public reunions are prohibited, they started to shoot.

An army both prey and liberticide makes a double edged sword, and that kinda sword is very dangerous both for those who control it and for those who want to make a coup d'etat, y'know.

###### Religion

Why is it Christless and Godless? It could've just been Godless, but Shelley wanted to reinforce the concept.

*"a sealed book"*: no one reads the Bible anymore.

###### Senate

Senate: Latin word.

*"Time's worst statute unrepealed"*: Shelley is talking about the law which prohibits Catholic people from having public positions. This is not fair! Still present law, because no English monarch can be Catholic, only Protestant.

Public office means everything that's got to do with the state, so even teaching is not an option.

###### Finally, graves


#### Other

He also writes an essay about how important it is to be a vegetarian.
