### Themes

#### Beauty

*A thing of beauty is a joy forever* - John Keats

To Keats, Beauty is the only consolation in a life of [sorrow and hardship](#deaths).

##### Physical Beauty

Physical Beauty produces intense **sensual** pleasure, but it is bound to **fade**.

##### Spiritual Beauty

Spiritual Beauty produces pleasure without senses, making it **immortal** and eternal.

He finds Spiritual Beauty in Art (Ellenic art), poetry and human emotions such as friendship and love.

###### Spiritual truth

Keats, in [Ode on a Grecian Urn](#ode-on-a-grecian-urn), equates Spiritual Beauty to the truth.

> Digression: In old forms of government, such as Ancient Greece's, the beautiful man was bound to rule. A beautiful man was also a truthful one, so one could say that, for their society, Physical Beauty and Spiritual Beauty were linked.

#### Negative capability

Keats usually didn't want to be *present* in his poems. His "I" has a more universal value.

> Not in the [Ode](#ode-on-a-grecian-urn) though! He shows himself.

He describes the poet as a **chameleon**: someone that assumes the shape (in this case, the emotions and character) of what he wants to describe.

#### Nature

To Keats, Nature is a form of Beauty. Natural elements are **recurrent** in his works. 


Nature is **eternal**: even though flowers and plants die, they **regenerate** every year.

> But man is not eternal. Man confronts death.
