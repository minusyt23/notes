# William Wordsworth

## Life

Born in 1770, Lockermouth. 

Gets degree at Cambridge University in 1791.

He left for France, where he stayed for a year. He had an affair with Annette Vallon, and the two had a daughter.

Why did he go to France though? Because, like others of his generation, he is enthusiastic about the [French revolution](french-revolution.md), and its ideals.

Once the revoluntions started to get violent, though, he became afraid of it. This is because he was afraid that he would find another **civil war** in England, since the revolution was spreading.

After what became of the revolution, he had a change of mind: his thoughts were more on the **conservative** side, in political and religious matters.

He came back to England. He settled in **Southwest England**, with his sister Dorothy.

In 1795 he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and together they wrote the [Lyrical Ballads](lyrical-ballads.md). 

Wordsworth also wrote the **manifesto of Romantic poetry**, the [Preface](preface.md)
